                    <em><u>Because I am a huge fan of mindfulness and meditation, my portfolio is themed around this, though I encourage everyone to practise meditation and mindfulness, I appreciate you may not have the time to take to see my portfolio in this light, therefore I have added a "Short on time?" mode, please feel free to use it. I hope you like the uniqueness.</u></em>

                  <p>
                    First and foremost is I am eager to learn as much as I can, self improvement in both a personal and work sense highly appeals to me.
                    My IT experience compliments my development career as it gives me a very rounded view on how technology works as a whole, allowing me to think outside the box.
    
                    I very much enjoy structure mixed with creativity, this is perfect within development as it allows me to come up with unique results and ideas.
    
                    In my spare time, I'm creating my own MMORPG game using Unity as the game engine, this has taught me a lot and the knowledge I have gained I am currently using within a work environment, it has excelled my learning experience because of my eargerness and urge to continously improve myself.
    
                    I also implement programming electronic solutions with a Raspberry Pi and Arduinos, my latest project is a replicating remote control.
    
                    Last thing you'll need to know about me, is I have a passion for Linux (Though will use all other OS's), this was born out of the years of Windows Updates randomly turning off my computer, and uninvited BSODs through the years.
    
                    I have found Linux to be not only reliable, but powerful for a power user, it's sped up so much of my workflow in my personal time.
